<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: DEEP LEARNING TO IDENTIFY PLANT SPECIES</h3>
<p>The project<b>"Deep Learning to identify plant species"</b> aims for faster detection and recognition of plant
species. We have introduced the <b>CNN</b>.</p>
<p>We developed a project to detect the plant species by using<b>PyCharm, Anaconda and Keras</b></p>
<p>The system was developed using Python with the help of some libraries, like<b>Numpy, Pandas,</b> data handling
and preprocessing.</p>
<p>Deep learning algorithms were applied, like<b>CNN</b>, which is used for <b>image or object recognition,
classification</b> and <b>feature extraction</b>.</p> <hr/>
